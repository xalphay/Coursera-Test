                        Chicken is delicious,Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F, place the chicken breast on a tin foil lined sheet tray, and bake in the oven for 15-18 minutes. The key to not overcooking the chicken breast is to take its temperature using a digital probe thermometer that can stay in the oven during the cooking process.

                        Sushi is delicious, Sushi is traditionally made with medium-grain white rice, though it can be prepared with brown rice or short-grain rice. It is very often prepared with seafood, such as squid, eel, yellowtail, salmon, tuna or imitation crab meat. Many types of sushi are vegetarian. It is often served with pickled ginger (gari), wasabi, and soy sauce. Daikon radish or pickled daikon (takuan) are popular garnishes for the dish.
                        Sushi is sometimes confused with sashimi, a related dish in Japanese cuisine that consists of thinly sliced raw fish, or occasionally meat, and an optional serving of rice.[2]
